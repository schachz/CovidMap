# Covid Deaths - Data Visualisation Map

I created this chart using R code and data downloaded from 'Our World in Data.' The chart shows total Covid deaths per million people by country at two different dates. It compares deaths per million as of March 29th, 2020 vs deaths per million 1 year later on March 29th, 2021. The color gradients shows countries with lower deaths in blue, countries with medium deaths in yellow and countries with higher deaths in brown.
